[h1]MOD STATUS - ALPHA[/h1]

[h1]Mod Aim[/h1]

The Information Age aims to bring forward anmmersive geopolitical simulator starting from 2018, aiming to balance sandbox and realism. A compromise between Modern Day 4 and Millennium Dawn Classic is very possible!

DLC's are always recommended, but not required.
Together for Victory is very very very recommended, due to the puppet system.
