[h1]MOD STATUS - ALPHA[/h1]

[h1]Mod Aim[/h1]

The Information Age aims to bring forward an immersive geopolitical simulator starting from 2018, aiming to balance sandbox and realism. A compromise between Modern Day 4 and Millennium Dawn Classic is very possible!

DLC's are always recommended, but not required.
Together for Victory is very very very recommended, due to the puppet system.

[h1]DISCLAIMER: This mod does currently NOT intend to add national focuses, as we consider them too linear and they are not compatible with how we want this mod to work. Their purpose is replaced by other systems and content.[/h1]
