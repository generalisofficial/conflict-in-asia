Brainstorming:
- Civil wars, gouvernemnt changes and civil unrest because of party popularity are cause by events that trigger when the popularity reaches a certain level
-> This means that we need to add the value used in the coalition system to those events. Why adding? Because running a country without a coalition is obviously possible too.

- After elections, if the party did not reach over 50% popularity it will get the option to for a coalition with other parties. Issue here are the conditions under which the AI will say yes or no to somthing like that. We could base it on democratic values and random (Like Fascist + Liberals is very unlikely though not impossible because of random)
- Should the coalition popularity be visible in the Top Bar like in Calm before the Storm?
- Coalitions will have to be inserted into history files. -> Values in history files possible? If not, event on startup.
- Decisions could be added to have talks with other parties before elections take place to improve the possibility of creating a coalition.
- A decision to leave the coalition / break it up could be possible.

- Coalitions will be combining values of parties into a TAG.coalition value, different per country and per tag obviously.

- It needs scripted localisation, no scripted GUI, localisation, and event scripting.
